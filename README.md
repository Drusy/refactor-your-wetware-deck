# Pragmatic Thinking & Learning - Refactor Your Wetware (Andy Hunt)

>You are used to working with software and hardware, but what about working with wetware—your own brain?
>
>Whether you’re a programmer, manager, knowledge worker, technogeek, or deep thinker, or if you just happen to have a human brain you’d like to crank up, Pragmatic Thinking and Learning will help with real understanding and effective techniques. These aren’t simple party tricks or lame ways to memorize lists of numbers. With this book, you can refactor your “wetware”—redesign and rewire your brain—to make you more effective at your job.
>
>In this book by Pragmatic cofounder Andy Hunt, you’ll learn how our brains are wired, and how to take advantage of your brain’s architecture. You’ll learn new tricks and tips to learn more, faster, and retain more of what you learn.
>
>Andy says, “From The Pragmatic Programmer through Practices of an Agile Developer, I’ve always tried to help find ways to make developers’ lives easier. That’s why we started the Pragmatic Bookshelf. In Pragmatic Thinking and Learning, I’ve accumulated ideas from a wide variety of sources and disciplines to help get at the root of the problem: better ways of approaching thinking and learning. Technology will always come and go, but this is the stuff that really makes a difference.”

>Programmers in particular have to learn constantly; not just the stereotypical new technologies, but also the problem domain of the application, the whims of the user community, the quirks of your teammates, the shifting sands of the industry, and the evolving characteristics of the project itself as it is built.
>
>In this book you’ll find a lot to think about, including bits of cognitive and neuroscience, learning and behavioral theory. You’ll see some surprising aspects of how our brains work, and how you can take advantage of the system to improve your own learning and thinking skills.
